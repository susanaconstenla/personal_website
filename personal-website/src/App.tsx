      'Studies machine learning–based predictability of socioeconomic indicators, combining insights on the role of dynamic covariates and the temporal representativeness of training data. It leverages large-scale secondary data sources such as satellite imagery.',

    body: [
      "This project studies the machine learning–based predictability of child malnutrition in shock-prone, data-constrained settings, with a focus on how dynamic covariates, the temporal representativeness of training data, and measurement constraints jointly shape predictive performance.",

      "Despite advances in the availability of large-scale data and machine learning methods, predictive models of acute malnutrition have historically exhibited limited predictive skill, particularly at subnational scales and for forward-looking forecasts. A central challenge is that acute malnutrition evolves rapidly in response to shocks, generating nonstationary outcome dynamics that are difficult to learn from low-frequency or cross-sectional data.",

      "The empirical approach combines remotely sensed covariates with high-frequency time-series anthropometric data from sentinel surveillance systems to model the evolving determinants of malnutrition. The results show that predictive performance improves substantially when models are trained on data that more closely reflect current conditions, overcoming the rapid distribution shift that characterizes this empirical setting.",

      "These findings highlight that limitations in predictive performance arise less from the availability of adequate optimization methods or predictive covariates than from constraints in outcome measurement and the extent to which training data remain representative of evolving conditions over time.",

      "These advances have enabled the implementation of a fully integrated early warning system within the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), Kenya’s national drought management agency operating in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL), where ward-level predictions of acute malnutrition inform anticipatory action and social protection responses to child hunger crises."

    body: [
  "A central component of my research agenda focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of machine learning–based predictive systems in real-world policy environments. Building on predictive frameworks developed in prior work, I examine and develop solutions for operationalizing such systems within government decision-making processes and linking them to anticipatory action.",
  
  "Child malnutrition remains a leading contributor to child mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 45% of deaths among children under five. In regions such as the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) of Kenya, recurrent droughts, conflict, and economic shocks generate persistently high levels of acute malnutrition, creating a critical need for timely and well-targeted interventions. While early warning systems have improved monitoring and coordination, they have historically remained largely reactive and have not systematically translated data into pre-defined, trigger-based responses.",

  "To address these limitations, I lead the development and implementation, in partnership with the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), Kenya’s national agency responsible for drought risk management, of a machine learning–based forecasting and triggering system for child malnutrition crises in the country's ASAL. The system integrates high-frequency anthropometric data with predictive models to generate forward-looking signals of child malnutrition and links these forecasts to pre-defined anticipatory action protocols.",

  "A central contribution of this work is to move beyond predictive performance and assess whether forecast-based systems can be operationalized to improve outcomes. By embedding the system within existing government infrastructure and linking predictions to rule-based interventions, the project creates a setting to evaluate the causal impact of anticipatory action on the evolution of child malnutrition.",

  "The empirical analysis uses a quasi-experimental impact evaluation design to estimate the effects of piloting the system across selected wards in Kenya’s ASAL regions. By comparing treated and control areas, the project evaluates whether forecast-driven interventions lead to earlier responses and reductions in acute malnutrition prevalence, providing evidence on the effectiveness of integrating machine learning into humanitarian decision-making."

  summary:
    'Develops methods to estimate the minimum sample size required to retrain machine learning models under distribution shift, ensuring stable predictive performance and reliable estimation in data-scarce and evolving environments.',

  body: [
    "Machine learning–based predictive systems are increasingly deployed in policy and humanitarian applications, where they are used to inform targeting, forecasting, and early warning. In these settings, which are often shock-prone and characterized by rapidly changing conditions, models are frequently applied across new spatial or temporal domains, giving rise to distribution shift: the deterioration of predictive performance when the training domain differs from the deployment domain across space or time.",

    "Existing approaches to addressing distribution shift—such as domain generalization, invariant representation learning, and test-time adaptation—typically rely on assumptions that are unlikely to hold in the small-sample, shock-prone, tabular data settings common in applied economics. In particular, these methods often require large labeled datasets, continuous data streams, or stable representations across environments. When shifts are driven by structural changes—such as climatic shocks, policy interventions, or market disruptions—these approaches are often insufficient to maintain predictive performance.",

    "Maintaining predictive performance under such shifts therefore requires retraining models using newly collected data, raising a central question: what is the minimum sample size required to restore predictive performance in the target domain?",

    "I develop a bootstrap-based approach, anchored in non-asymptotic concentration theory, to estimate the minimum sample size required for retraining machine learning regression models under distribution shift. The proposed framework identifies the smallest data collection sufficient to recover stable predictive performance in the target domain, directly addressing a key constraint in data-scarce environments where survey-based data collection is costly and logistically constrained.",

    "Empirically, I show that restoring predictive performance after distribution shift is closely linked to capturing the essential features of the outcome distribution in the retraining sample. Across applications, relatively modest sample sizes are sufficient to recover and stabilize predictive performance. This reflects the stability of the concentration properties of the outcome distribution across environments, which allows sample size estimates calibrated on pre-shift data to remain informative after distribution shift.",

    "The broader aim of this work is to provide practical methodological guidance for the scalable and sustained use of machine learning–based predictive systems in policy environments, where models must be updated across space and time but data collection remains a binding constraint."

                      I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley School of Information, working at the intersection of economics and machine learning for international development. My research focuses on machine learning–based predictability of socioeconomic indicators for social protection and humanitarian response, as well as the deployment and evaluation of predictive systems based on these methodological advances in policy environments.

                      I study how these systems can be implemented and assessed using experimental and quasi-experimental causal inference methods, and how their performance can be sustained over time and across contexts under distribution shift.

                    The number of acutely food insecure people worldwide has doubled since 2017, increasing demand for early warning systems (EWS) that can predict food emergencies. Advances in computational methods and the growing availability of near-real-time remote sensing data suggest that big data approaches might help meet this need. This work shows that incorporating high-frequency monitoring of child malnutrition into machine learning models substantially improves predictive performance, enabling more timely and accurate early warning.

                    As resilience measurement becomes central to development policy, multiple approaches have emerged. This paper compares three widely used resilience measurement frameworks using panel data from Ethiopia and Niger, showing that they produce substantially different classifications and exhibit only modest predictive performance.
